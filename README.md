## 🧠 Core Components

### 1. Data Layer

**Data Manager** (`data_layer/data_manager.py`)
- Fetch OHLCV data from multiple sources (yfinance, Alpaca, Polygon)
- Calculate technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, ATR, etc.)
- Handle data caching and real-time updates

**Feature Engineer** (`data_layer/feature_engineer.py`)
- Create 50+ engineered features from raw price data
- Sequence creation for RNN models (60-period lookback window)
- Feature scaling (standard, MinMax) and dimensionality reduction (PCA)
- Train/validation/test split with temporal awareness

### 2. Model Layer

**Neural Network Models** (`model_layer/neural_networks.py`)

- **LSTM Model**: 
  - 2-layer LSTM with 128 hidden units
  - Dropout for regularization
  - Early stopping with validation monitoring

- **GRU Model**:
  - Lighter GRU alternative for faster training
  - 2-layer GRU with 64 hidden units

- **Ensemble Model**:
  - Combines multiple models with weighted averaging
  - Reduces overfitting through model diversity

Training features:
- Adam optimizer with learning rate scheduling
- Gradient clipping for stability
- MSE/MAE loss functions
- GPU support (CUDA)

### 3. Strategy Layer

**Quantitative Trading Strategies** (`strategy_layer/quant_strategies.py`)

1. **Mean Reversion Strategy**
   - Trades when price deviates 2σ from 20-period mean
   - Profitable in range-bound markets

2. **Momentum Strategy**
   - 12/26 EMA crossovers with dynamic thresholds
   - Catches trends early in volatile markets

3. **Statistical Arbitrage**
   - Z-score based entry/exit signals
   - Exploits temporary price divergences

4. **Market Making** (Advanced)
   - Optimal bid-ask spread calculation
   - Inventory management

5. **Portfolio Optimization**
   - Markowitz efficient frontier
   - Risk parity weighting

6. **Strategy Ensemble**
   - Combines all strategies with weighted voting
   - Reduces single-strategy risk

### 4. Risk Management

**Risk Manager** (`risk_management/risk_manager.py`)

Position Sizing Methods:
- **Kelly Criterion**: f* = (bp - q) / b with 0.25 fraction
- **Risk Parity**: Target risk % per position
- **Fixed Size**: Manual position sizing
- **Proportional**: % of portfolio

Risk Controls:
- Max position size: 10% of portfolio
- Max daily loss: 5% of portfolio
- Max drawdown: 20% limit
- Circuit breakers for abnormal losses
- Correlation analysis to prevent concentration

Stop Loss & Take Profit:
- Hard stops at fixed levels
- Trailing stops that follow price
- Dynamic adjustments based on volatility

Value at Risk (VaR):
- Historical VaR at 95% confidence
- Conditional VaR (Expected Shortfall)

### 5. Execution Engine

**Trading Engine** (`execution_layer/trading_engine.py`)

Features:
- Unified interface for all trading modes
- Position tracking and P&L calculation
- Portfolio rebalancing
- Trade execution with slippage & commissions
- Real-time portfolio monitoring

### 6. Backtesting Engine

**Backtest Engine** (`backtesting/backtest_engine.py`)

Capabilities:
- Realistic transaction costs (commissions, slippage)
- Trade logging with full P&L
- Equity curve tracking
- Walk-forward analysis for out-of-sample testing

Performance Metrics:
- **Return Metrics**: Total return, annualized return
- **Risk Metrics**: Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, Calmar ratio
- **Drawdown Metrics**: Max drawdown, recovery time
- **Trade Metrics**: Win rate, profit factor, average win/loss

## 📈 Performance Metrics

### Key Ratios

**Sharpe Ratio** = (Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Volatility
- Target: > 1.0 is good, > 2.0 is excellent

**Sortino Ratio** = (Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Downside Volatility
- Penalizes only downside volatility

**Calmar Ratio** = Annual Return / Max Drawdown
- Target: > 1.0

**Profit Factor** = Gross Profit / Gross Loss
- Target: > 1.5 is profitable

**Win Rate** = Winning Trades / Total Trades
- Combined with profit factor matters more than win rate alone

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Backtesting Disclaimer**: Past performance does not guarantee future results. Models trained on historical data may not generalize to new market regimes.

2. **Risk Management**: Always use appropriate position sizing and risk controls. Never risk more than you can afford to lose.

3. **Market Regime Shifts**: The system should be monitored regularly and adjusted for changing market conditions.

4. **Transaction Costs**: Always include realistic commissions and slippage in backtests.

5. **Walk-Forward Analysis**: Use out-of-sample testing to validate strategy robustness.
